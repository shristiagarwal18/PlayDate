# PlayDate Idea
My 1st year project on Python language. I tried to make desktop application to ease life of pet owners. This idea is solution of my daily problem (being a pet owner).\
Playdate assists you in matching your beloved dog with a compatible mate. Finding a good spouse for your dog is a problem that, if not addressed, can result in the births of sick puppies. 
1. Covid Checker - Checking the number of covid cases in your state so you can see if it is safe to travel.
2. Security Layer - I intend on experimenting with different kinds of security systems. Possibly voice recognition, learning how to integrate various image processing libraries and some of the basic APIs such as Catchpa for safety.
3. More Pets - This project has the potential to be helpful for different animals as well.
4. Adoption - Removing the middlemen such as brokers who mistreat and often are abusive towards the puppies or baby animals, the user can put the puppies directly up for adoption and can directly reach families that actually want to care for the innocent animals.
5. Community Help - A community section can be added to the web application where there will be suggestions from actual verified pet owners and a place for influencers where they can bring pet owners closer to local businesses and brands to promote the Vocal for Local movement.
